It is well established that house prices are dynamic.
It is also axiomatic that location influences such selling prices,
motivating our objective of incorporating spatial information in explaining the evolution of house prices over time.
In this paper, we propose a rich class of spatio-temporal models under which each property is point referenced and its associated selling price modeled through a collection of temporally indexed spatial processes.
Such modeling includes and extends all house price index models currently in the literature,
and furthermore permits distinction between the effects of time and location.
We study single family residential sales in two distinct submarkets of a metropolitan area and further categorize the data into single- and multiple-transaction observations.
We find the spatial component is very important in explaining house price.
Moreover, the relative homogeneity of homes within the submarket and the frequency with which homes sell affects the pattern of variation across space and time.
Differences between single and repeat sale data are evident.
The methodology is applicable to more general capital asset pricing when location is anticipated to be influential.

The main purpose of this study is to propose and estimate a model of Korean rental housing choice using hierarchical logit analysis.
The study focuses on the examination of how households choose their dwelling units in a complex rental housing market.
The decision is viewed as a partial sequence process, beginning with the choice of rental housing tenure and finishing with a decision on the type of occupation.
To examine an additional step in the urban spatial structure, hedonic price technique is incorporated into a hierarchical logit model.
In addition, the separate effects of permanent and transitory components of measured income are examined through the instrumental variables method based on human capital theory.
It is shown that the proposed model provides a potentially more useful method than another model, the multinomial logit,
in analysing the Korean rental housing market.

This article analyzes the changes of equilibrium rent and equilibrium price of owner-occupied housing in Taiwan,
and also computes the rent multiplier and its trend in the past ten years in Taiwan to show how the housing consumption and housing investment change.
A hedonic rent equation and a hedonic housing price equation are built first.
Then, we apply the “Housing Survey Report” data from 1979 to 1989, and employ ordinary-least squares method to estimate the two equations.
Using estimated coefficients of the two equations, we compute the market rents for owner-occupied housing and the market prices for rental housing.
Finally, the rent multipliers are calculated from the market rents and market prices.
The article finds that (1) changes of housing prices in Taipei lead to price changes in Kaoshung, and the latter leads Taiwan province;
(2) changes of rent are much smaller than the changes of housing price; and (3) housing prices in Taiwan increased drastically.
We also find: (1) at the peak of the housing market cycle, the rent multiplier is extremely high;
(2) the rent multiplier drops in the year after the peak year because the rent catches up;
(3) the rent multiplier in Taipei is greater than that of Kaoshung, and the multiplier in Kaoshung is greater than that of Taiwan province;
and (4) overall, the rent multiplier in Taiwan is much greater than that of the United States.

  abstract  = {
This paper draws on three waves of Japan household longitudinal data (Keio Household Panel Survey, KHPS) and estimates a proportional hazard model to investigate the effects of two distinctive polices in Japan that influence residential moves.
One is the implementation of an income tax deduction system in 2004 for the carrying over of capital losses for owner-occupied households and the other is the Japan Rental Act for renter households.
The tax policy was devised to cope with the severe equity constraints that followed the bursting of Japan’s asset Bubble in the early 1990s.
The Rental Act (1921, amended in 1941) provides renters protection from eviction and is the basis for a court arbitrated rent control system.
We examine the effect of this rent control system on residential mobility based on an estimate of the implicit subsidy resulting from the Rental Act.
We find that both government policies have a strong impact on residential mobility.
The implementation of an income tax deduction system linked to capital losses increases owners’ mobility,
especially for those households with a large LTV (Loan to Value Ratio).
